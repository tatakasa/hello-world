# hello-world
My first repository
I am a fresher and I have taken training in software testing from a reputed institute. I have learnt functional and non-functional testing during my software testing training. I have executed a project in software testing where I used manual testing for the commonly used features of the application. I have written test cases for the manual execution and reported defects in Bugzilla. I am well versed with the testing concepts in black box testing. I am sure given a chance, I will be quick to learn and perform in a software testing project.
